Some notes on this project:

The transitions are much smoother on a high power computer and the composition looks best scaled up like with a projecter. This was a compilation of process projects so my code structure can be improved upon. Feel free to edit if you are going to use this!

In the sketch.js file I left a comment on line 12 where you may substitute your own mp3. Theres a copyright free placeholder for now.
